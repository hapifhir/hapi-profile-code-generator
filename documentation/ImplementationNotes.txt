Interface/Adapter Generation

== Handling Extensions ==
Create all extended types
Register new extended types
Create all first level extended getters and setters that reference these new types
Process regular (non-extended) attributes
Process all first level extensions (i.e., extensions that point to Core FHIR type)

== Currently Out-of-Scope ==
FHIR types that have extensions - How to address that? E.g., an extension on Boolean (yuck), Quantity, Address (e.g., preferred.)

== Bugs to fix ==
	- No accessor for new extended types
